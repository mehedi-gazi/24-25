## üîç Overview

This repository showcases the practical software development and research work I‚Äôve completed during my year in lieu of a traditional industry placement. The projects span multiple programming languages and domains, demonstrating depth in problem-solving, GUI design, systems programming, and frontend development.
My next stage I will prioritise is Embedded Systems Engineering mixed with machine learning as it coincides with past passion in mechanics and combine it with the digital aspect of computing.

Each subdirectory contains well-documented, working codebases, including:

---

### üü¶ C Projects (`/c-projects`)
- **Circuit-Mind**: A terminal-based digital logic puzzle game built with structs, pointers, and I/O handling in C.  
  Building on foundational concepts from **COM400 Mathematics for Computing** (algorithms, logic) and **COM410 Programming in Practice** (memory management, pointers), I implemented real digital circuit logic (AND, OR, XOR gates). This project strengthened my understanding of low-level system programming and efficient resource management, directly applying the theoretical foundations from these modules.

### ‚òï Java Projects (`/j-projects`)
- **ExpenseTracker-Swing**: A personal finance manager with Java Swing GUI.  
  Leveraging object-oriented programming principles and GUI design skills from **COM410 Programming in Practice**, this project showcases modular software design, event-driven programming, and file persistence. Additionally, skills from **COM435 Software Production & Process Management** helped me implement robust software lifecycle practices like testing and version control.

- **Flashcard-Swing**: An adaptive study app featuring spaced repetition and customizable decks.  
  Applying algorithmic thinking from **COM400 Mathematics for Computing** and GUI responsiveness from **COM410 Programming in Practice**, I developed an application that integrates spaced repetition techniques to optimize learning. This also reinforced my knowledge of user-centric design from **COM360 Professional Development**.

### üåê JavaScript Projects (`/js-projects`)
- **nexus-news**: A stylized news portal inspired by immersive game aesthetics like *Hitman II*.  
  Building upon web development fundamentals from **COM109 Interactive Web Authoring**, I implemented advanced layout techniques, responsive design, and dynamic content rendering. This project enhanced my practical skills in DOM manipulation and asynchronous JavaScript programming.

- **portfolio-v1**: A personal portfolio website (in progress) to showcase projects and deployments.  
  Consolidating front-end skills gained in **COM109 Interactive Web Authoring**, this project improves my ability to create clean, maintainable, and accessible web interfaces.

- **basics-js**: A collection of JavaScript mini-projects demonstrating DOM manipulation, logic, and UI responsiveness.  
  These exercises reinforced programming fundamentals from **COM109 Interactive Web Authoring** and helped me master event handling and browser APIs.

---

### üêç Python Projects (`/python-projects`)
- A suite of CLI tools and practical applications such as to-do managers, data fetchers, and planners.  
  Utilizing scripting, automation, and software design concepts from **COM410 Programming in Practice** and professional practices from **COM360 Professional Development**, I developed efficient command-line tools leveraging API integration and file I/O. This experience enhanced my rapid prototyping skills and practical problem-solving.

## üß† Technical Themes Across Projects

- System-level problem solving and logic from **COM400 Mathematics for Computing** and **COM410 Programming in Practice**.
- Object-oriented design, GUI development, and software lifecycle knowledge from **COM410** and **COM435**.
- Web design and frontend programming grounded in **COM109 Interactive Web Authoring**.
- Professional development and project management from **COM360**.
- Security and performance considerations from **COM398 Systems Security** (applied primarily in backend projects).

---

## üóÇÔ∏è How to Navigate
Each project includes:
- `README.md` for setup and overview
- Codebase with comments
- Screenshots or demos (where applicable)

---


I am confident these demonstrate my capability to contribute to real-world software environments.
