## 🔍 Overview

This repository showcases the practical software development and research work I’ve completed during my year in lieu of a traditional industry placement. The projects span multiple programming languages and domains, demonstrating depth in problem-solving, GUI design, systems programming, and frontend development.
My next stage I will prioritise is Embedded Systems Engineering mixed with machine learning as it coincides with past passion in mechanics and combine it with the digital aspect of computing.

Each subdirectory contains well-documented, working codebases, including:

## 💡 Key Highlights

### 🟦 C Projects (`/c-projects`)
- **Circuit-Mind**: A terminal-based digital logic puzzle game built with structs, pointers, and I/O handling in C. Mimics real circuit logic with AND, OR, XOR gates.
  - Skills: Memory management, terminal I/O, problem-solving.

---

### ☕ Java Projects (`/j-projects`)
- **ExpenseTracker-Swing**: Personal finance manager with Java Swing GUI. Allows users to log, edit, and visualize expenses using object-oriented design.
- **Flashcard-Swing**: Adaptive study app with GUI. Implements spaced repetition concepts and user-driven decks.
  - Skills: OOP, event handling, GUI design, file persistence.

---

### 🌐 JavaScript Projects (`/js-projects`)
- **nexus-news**: A stylized news portal inspired by immersive games like *Hitman II*. Focus on aesthetics, layout, and user experience.
- **portfolio-v1**: A personal portfolio website (in progress) to showcase work and future deployments.
- **basics-js**: Foundational JavaScript mini-projects demonstrating DOM manipulation, logic, and UI responsiveness.

---

### 🐍 Python Projects (`/python-projects`)
- A collection of CLI tools and practical daily-use apps (e.g., to-do managers, fetchers, planners).
  - Skills: API usage, CLI building, file I/O, script automation.

---

## 🧠 Technical Themes Across Projects
- System-level problem solving using C.
- GUI and real-world app design with Java Swing.
- Web development and frontend design using JavaScript/HTML/CSS.
- Rapid scripting and prototyping with Python.
- Git-based project management, versioning, and documentation.

---

## 🗂️ How to Navigate
Each project includes:
- `README.md` for setup and overview
- Codebase with comments
- Screenshots or demos (where applicable)
